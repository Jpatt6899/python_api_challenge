# python_api_challenge

Hello! 


This repository contains 2 codes. 


-The folder weather_py provideds a large 500+ random sample of citys from around the world. The code then builds a dataframe containing country, latitude, longitude, tempature, humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed. Fianlly it provdes scartter plots to compare tempature, humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed to latitude. 


- The folder vaction_py provides a code to examine the  weather csv emported from the weather_py code above, located in the resource folder. The code shows a google api heat map that indicates ideal weather as defined in the code peramiters. It then uses google api to locate a hotel within 5000 meters of the city latitude and longitude location. 



Take aways from this analysis:


1. The closer to the latitude of 0 the higher weather tempatature. 
2. Unfortually no matter the latitude of a city,thsi has no affect on the cloudiness percentage. 
3. When chosing a vation destination based on weather, Miraflores, Mexico would be great choice. A Hotel in that city is the Hotel Masion.
